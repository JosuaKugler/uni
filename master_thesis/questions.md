## What is an almost contact structure?
reduction of structure group to U(n)x 1 (see [Agustin's slides](./papers/Moreno24_slides.pdf))
-> What does that mean?
see Geiges, p. 64, Rmk 2.4.7
almost contact structure is a cooriented hyperplane field eta with a complex bundle structure J and a oriented line-bundle complementary to eta that defines the coorientation
### What is a bundle metric?
Let E -> M a bundle. A bundle metric is a bundle map from the fibre product of E with itself to M x \R
s.t. the reduction to each fibre is a nondegenerate bilinear form.
The fibre product is very similar to the product, only that the product maps need to fit with the 



## Why does the definition of weak filling make sense?
What does it mean for a symplectic form to be restricted to a contact structure?
A symplectic form on a mfd associates a skew-symmetric bilinear form to every point of the manifold. The contact structure on the boundary manifold associates a plane to every point. Therefore, at each point we have to consider the restriction of the form to the 2-d subvectorspace of the 4-d tangent space.
