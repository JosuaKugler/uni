## Outline

1. Repeat contact geometry basics
-> Read Geiges and lecture notes
lecture notes:
repeat chapters 3 and 4 
Geiges:
8.1 could be interesting -> unfortunately can't understand it due to lack of algebraic topology knowledge
chapter 7 on open books and branched covers
introduction refers back to chapter 4.4 for the 3-dim case
-> abstract open books
- 7.3 -> proof of Bourgeois construction on p. 349
What is a contact submanifold?
What is the definition of an open book supporting a contact structure?
- 7.5
2. Bourgeois construction
- see geiges 7.3
- Bourgeois construction yields tight mfd. -> BGM22, complicated
3. Overtwisted
- Plastikstufe (Niederkr√ºger)
- OT disk (BEM15)
- geometric criteria (CMP19). Tfae: Y
    - is overtwisted (according to BEM15)
    - contains R^3 X C^n-2
    - unknot is loose
    - contains plastikstufe (doesn't need further technical conditions according to Huang17)
    - can be obtained by (+1)-surgery
    - is supported by a negatively stabilized open book
