## Outline

1. Repeat contact geometry basics
-> Read Geiges and lecture notes
lecture notes:
repeat chapters 3 and 4 
Geiges:
8.1 could be interesting -> unfortunately can't understand it due to lack of algebraic topology knowledge
chapter 7 on open books and branched covers
introduction refers back to chapter 4.4 for the 3-dim case
-> abstract open books
- 7.3 -> proof of Bourgeois construction on p. 349
What is a contact submanifold?
What is the definition of an open book supporting a contact structure?
- 7.5
2. Learn Bourgeois construction
