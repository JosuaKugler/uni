The goal is to find homotopically standard, tight, non-fillable contact structures on the sphere $S^{2n+1}$ for $n \geq 2$.
In this work, only the easier case $n \geq 3$ will be covered.
As $(S^{2n+1}, \xi_\mathrm{std})$ is defined as the contact boundary of the standard symplectic ball $(D^{2n+2}, \omega_\mathrm{std})$,
it is fillable by definition.
Hence, one needs a different contact structure.
This chapter explains how to construct a homotopically standard contact structure on the sphere in a way that at first might not seem very intuitive,
hoping that in the end it will be different from $\xi_\mathrm{std}$.
Later, in \cref{chap:tightness} and \cref{chap:nonfillable}, it will be shown that, as desired, this contact structure really is tight and non-fillable 
(and hence different from $\xi_\mathrm{std}$).
The starting point for the whole construction is a Milnor open book, i.e. a certain kind of decomposition of $S^{2n-1}$ that comes from
Milnors work on hypersurface singularities \cite{Milnor69}.
By the Giroux correspondence, there is a contact structure on this manifold.
In this case, part of the Giroux correspondence can be realized by an explicit construction due to Thurston-Winkelnkemper.
Now, a construction due to Bourgeois (\cite{Bourgeois02}) extends the resulting contact structure on $S^{2n-1}$ to $S^{2n-1}\times T^2$.
By applying smooth surgery, one can kill the homology in the $T^2$-factor and so obtain $S^{2n+1}$.
By an $h$-principle due to Eliashberg--Murphy (\cite[section 12.4]{EM02}), the surgeries can be realized as contact surgeries.
This completes the construction as now one has a contact structure on $S^{2n+1}$.
Finally, in \cref{homotopically_standard}, it will be explained why the contact structure is homotopically standard.
