Define $f\colon \mathbb C^n \to \mathbb C$ by
\[
    (z_0, \dots, z_{n-1}) \mapsto z_0^k + z_1^2 + \dots z_{n-1}^2.  
\]
Consider the sphere $S^{2n-1} \subset \mathbb C^n$.
The intersection $f^{-1}(0) \cap S^{2n-1}$ is the so called Brieskorn sphere $B = \Sigma_{n-1}(k,2,\dots,2)$.
On the complement $S^{2n-1} \setminus B$, the map
\[
    \pi_f\colon S^{2n-1}\setminus B \to S^1\colon (z_0, \dots, z_{n-1}) \mapsto \frac{f(z_0, \dots, z_{n-1})}{|f(z_0, \dots, z_{n-1})|}
\]
is a fibration over $S^1$, the Milnor fibration.
According to \cref{def:open_book_2}, this is an open book where the fibers of the Milnor fibration (i.e. the Milnor fibers) form the pages.
%We only need to show that all points with $|f(x)| < 1$ are regular points.
%This is easy to see for all points except $0$. 
%At $0$, however, I don't think it's true as $Tf_0 = 0$.


%Mention the properties that Agustin told me
%- looks like spheres merged at one point
%- homotopy of half-dimension CW complex
%- homology properties?
