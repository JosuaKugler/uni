So far, a tight and homotopically standard contact structure $(S^{2n+1}, \xi_\text{new})$ has been constructed on all odd-dimensional spheres.
This would be not very interesting by itself, as even the standard contact structure satisfies these properties.
This chapter, however, proves that $\xi_\text{new}$ is non-fillable and thereby finishes the proof.

The idea is to first assume that $(S^{2n+1}, \xi_\text{new})$ is fillable and then derive a contradiction.
Call the hypothetical filling $W_\text{surg}$. 

The proof essentially is a clever application of holomorphic curves.
As the dimension is potentially very large, one needs a good way to leverage holomorphic curves techniques.
This takes quite some geometric construction work: 
Convex decomposition is a method to split a convex hypersurface into two Liouville domains separated by the dividing set $\Gamma$.
In particular, this can be used to split the Bourgeois manifold into two Giroux domains (which basically are Liouville domains times $S^1$).
Specifically for such Giroux domains, there is a certain type of surgery, called ``blow down operation" that removes the
interior of the domain and blows down its boundary.
Applying this blow down operation to the decomposed and surgered Bourgeois manifold, one obtains a
capping cobordism from $S^{2n+1}$ to $\Gamma \times S^2$.
Stacked on top of $W_\text{surg}$, this is a filling of $\Gamma \times S^2$.

The $S^2$-factor is precisely what was needed, 
because it can be used to define a suitable moduli space of holomorphic curves. 
Given some regularity properties, this moduli space is the foundation for the proof of the homological obstruction theorem.
\begin{theorem}[Homological obstruction theorem]\label{th:homological_obstruction}
    Any homology class in the dividing set $\Gamma$ that dies in the filling $W$, will also die in $V_\pm$.
\end{theorem}
\Cref{sec:proof_hom_obstr} makes this theorem more precise and provides a proof sketch, assuming that the moduli space and
related objects are smooth manifolds.
Finally, in \cref{sec:homology_class}, a homology class in $\Gamma$ is constructed that survives in $V_\pm$, but assuming
the existence of a filling, would die in the filling. This is the desired contradiction.
