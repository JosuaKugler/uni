\subsection{Example: Bourgeois and Thurston-Winkelnkemper combined}
Consider an abstract open book $(\Sigma, \phi)$ satisfying the
conditions required for applying the Thurston-Winkelnkemper-construction.
Then, the construction yields a contact form $\alpha_\text{ext}$ on
\[
    M = \left(\Sigma_{\overline{\varphi}}(\phi)\; \dot\cup\; \mathcal{N}\right)/\sim.
\]
Now, carry out the Bourgeois construction and obtain a contact form
\[
    \tilde \alpha_\text{ext} = \alpha_\text{ext} + x_1 \d \theta_1 - x_2 \d\theta_2
\]
on $M \times T^2$ where $\theta_1, \theta_2$ are coordinates on $T^2$
and $x_1, x_2$ are coordinates as described in the section on the Bourgeois construction, 
i.e. there is a function $\rho: M \to [0,1]$ that agrees with $r$ near the binding $B$ and define
\[
    x_1 \coloneqq \rho \cos(p);\qquad x_2 \coloneqq \rho \sin(p).
\]

Inside $\mathcal{N}$, the projection map $p$ is given by the angular coordinate $\varphi$. Therefore,
\[
    \alpha|_\mathcal{N} = \alpha_\text{ext} = h_1(r)\beta_\partial + h_2(r)\d \varphi = h_1(r)\beta_\partial + h_2(r)\d p.
\]
In total, the contact form on $\mathcal{U} \coloneqq \mathcal{N}\times T^2$ is
\[
    \tilde \alpha = h_1(r)\beta_\partial + h_2(r)\d p + \rho(r)(\cos(p) \d \theta_1 - \sin(p) \d \theta_2)
\]
Outside $\mathcal{U}$, the form is given by
\[
    \tilde \alpha = \beta + \d p + \cos(p) \d\theta_1 - \sin(p) \d \theta_2,
\]
as $\rho(r) = 1\; \forall r \geq 1$.
Collecting all the conditions on $h_1$ and $h_2$ from the last section, the requirements are
\begin{itemize}
    \item $h_1(r) = e^s = e^{1-r}, h_2(r) = 1$ in the gluing area ($ 1 \le r \le 2$).
    \item Smoothness around the binding and contact condition on the binding: $h_1(r) = 2 - r^2$ and $h_2(r) = r^2$ around $r = 0$.
    The $-r^2$-part is only important to have $h_1'(r) < 0$ around $0$ to satisfy the symplectic condition on the pages.
    \item Contact condition on the tubular neighborhood: \[
        h_1(r)^{n-1}\det \begin{pmatrix}
            h_1(r) & h_2(r)/r\\
            h_1'(r) & h_2'(r)/r
        \end{pmatrix} > 0 \qquad \forall r \in [0,2].
    \]
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Reeb dynamics}\label{reeb_dynamics}
In the following, the Reeb vector field of the Bourgeois manifold from the last paragraph is computed.
Define two functions $\mu, \nu: M \to \mathbb R$ as follows:
\[
    \mu = \begin{cases}
        \frac{\rho'}{\rho' h_1 - \rho h_1'} &\text{inside } \mathcal{U}\\
        0 &\text{outside } \mathcal{U} 
    \end{cases}  
    \quad \text{and} \quad 
    \nu = \begin{cases}
        \frac{-h_1'}{\rho' h_1 - \rho h_1'} &\text{inside } \mathcal{U}\\
        1 &\text{outside } \mathcal{U}
    \end{cases}.
\]
Both $\mu$ and $\nu$ are smooth.
First of all, note that both are quotients of smooth functions.
We have to make sure that $\rho'h_1 \neq \rho h_1'$.
All of the involved functions are non-negative except for $h_1'$, which is constantly negative ($h_1$ needs to be chosen in such a way that $h_1'$ is nonzero). As a result,
\[
    \rho'h_1 > 0 > \rho h_1',
\]
so the denominator is always nonzero.
As $\rho$ is constantly 1 for $r \geq 1$, $\mu$ must be 0 for $r \geq 1$.
In particular, it is smooth everywhere. For $\nu$, setting $\rho \equiv 1$ implies $\rho' = 0$ on $r \geq 1$. Therefore, the denominator simplifies to 1 and $\nu$ is smooth, too.
\begin{lemma}
    The Reeb vector field of the contact form $\tilde \alpha$ is given by
    \[
        R = \mu(r)R_B + \nu(r)[\cos(p)\partial_{\theta_1} - \sin(p)\partial_{\theta_2}],
    \]
    where $R_B$ is the Reeb vector field of $\beta_\partial$, the contact form on $\partial \Sigma$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    Inside $\mathcal{U}$,
    \begin{align*}
        \tilde\alpha(R) &= h_1(r)\beta_\partial(R) + h_2(r)\d p(R) + \rho(r)(\cos(p) \d \theta_1 - \sin(p) \d \theta_2)(R)\\
        \intertext{$\beta_\partial$ and $\d p$ are 0 on $\partial_{\theta_i}$, $p$ and $\theta_i$ are constant on $R_B$}
        &= h_1\mu\beta_\partial(R_B) + \rho\nu(\cos(p) \d \theta_1 - \sin(p) \d \theta_2)(\cos(p)\partial_{\theta_1} - \sin(p)\partial_{\theta_2})\\
        &= h_1 \mu + \rho\nu[\cos(p)\cos(p) + \sin(p)\sin(p)]\\
        &= \frac{h_1\rho'}{\rho'h_1 - \rho h_1'} + \frac{- \rho h_1'}{\rho'h_1 - \rho h_1'}\\
        &= 1.
    \end{align*}
    Computing $\d \tilde\alpha$, one can immediately drop the $\d r$-terms, as they evaluate to $0$ on $R$.
    \begin{align*}
        \d\tilde \alpha(R, \cdot) &= h_1(r)\d \beta_\partial(R, \cdot) - \rho(r)[\sin(p)\d p \wedge \d \theta_1 + \cos(p) \d p\wedge \d \theta_2](R, \cdot)
        \intertext{$\beta_\partial$ and $\d p$ are 0 on $\partial_{\theta_i}$, $\d \beta_\partial(R_B) = 0$, $p$ is 0 on $R_B$}
        &= \rho(r)\left[\sin(p)\d\theta_1(R)\d p + \cos(p)\theta_2(R)\d p\right]
        \intertext{$\d \theta_i$ is 0 on $R_B$}
        &= \rho(r)\nu(r)\left[\sin(p)\cos(p) - \cos(p)\sin(p)\right]\d p\\
        &= 0
    \end{align*}
    Outside $\mathcal{U}$,
    \[
        R = \cos(p)\partial_{\theta_1} - \sin(p)\partial_{\theta_2}.  
    \]
    Therefore,
    \begin{align*}
        \tilde\alpha(R) &= \beta(R) + \d p(R) + \cos(p) \d\theta_1(R) - \sin(p) \d \theta_2(R)\\
        \intertext{$\beta$ and $\d p$ are 0 on $\partial_{\theta_i}$}
        &= [\cos(p) \d \theta_1 - \sin(p) \d \theta_2](\cos(p)\partial_{\theta_1} - \sin(p)\partial_{\theta_2})\\
        &= \cos(p)\cos(p) + \sin(p)\sin(p)\\
        &= 1
    \end{align*}
    Also,
    \begin{align*}
        \d \tilde\alpha(R) &= \d \beta(R, \cdot) - \sin(p)\d p \wedge \d\theta_1(R, \cdot) - \cos(p)\d p \wedge \d \theta_2(R, \cdot)\\
        \intertext{$\beta$ and $\d p$ are 0 on $\partial_{\theta_i}$}
        &= \sin(p)\d \theta_1(R) \d p + \cos(p)\d\theta_2(R)\d p\\
        &= \sin(p)\cos(p) \d p - \cos(p)\sin(p)\d p\\
        &= 0
    \end{align*}
\end{proof}

This computation is needed in the proof of \cref{binding_adc}, cf.~\cite[Lemma 2.8]{BGMZ22}
