\begin{definition}[ideal Liouville domain] \cite[Definition 1]{Giroux20}
An ideal Liouville domain
$(F, \omega)$ is a domain $F$ endowed with an ideal Liouville structure $\omega$. This
ideal Liouville structure is an exact symplectic form on $\operatorname{int} F$
admitting a primitive $\lambda$ such that: for some (and then any) function 
$u \colon F \to \mathbb R_{\geq 0}$  with regular level set $\partial F = \{u = 0\}$,
the product $u\lambda$ extends to a smooth 1-form on $F$ which 
induces a contact form on $\partial F$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[corresponding Giroux domain]\cite[Section 5.3]{MNW13}
    \label{def:giroux_domain}
    Given an ideal Liouville domain $(F, \omega)$ with primitive $\lambda$
    and function $u \colon F \to \mathbb R_{\geq 0}$ as above,
    the corresponding Giroux domain is given by
    \[
        F \times S^1_\theta
    \]
    endowed with contact structure
    \[
        \ker(u \d \theta + u \lambda)
    \]
\end{definition}

Start with a Bourgeois manifold $\operatorname{BO}(\Sigma,\dots)$.
Smoothly, we have
\[
    \operatorname{BO}(\Sigma,\dots) = \operatorname{OB}(\Sigma, \dots) \times T^2 
    = \big[\operatorname{OB}(\Sigma, \dots) \times S^1\big] \times S^1 
    \eqqcolon V \times S^1
\]
According to \cite[Section 6]{DG12} we obtain a convex decomposition of the first factor
\[
    V = V_+ \bigcup_\Gamma \overline{V}_-,
\]
where $V_\pm$ are ideal Liouville domains and $\Gamma$ is the dividing set.
In \cite[Section 5.3]{DG12}, the authors explicitly compute $\Gamma$ and 
$V_\pm$ for the Bourgeois construction and obtain %maybe make a picture here?
\[
    \Gamma = \{y = 0\} = p^{-1}(\{0\}) \cup_B p^{-1}(\{\pi\})
\]
and
\[
    V_+ = p^{-1}([0, \pi]) \times S^1, \qquad V_- = p^{-1}([\pi, 2\pi]) \times S^1,
\]
i.e. topologically we get $V_\pm = \Sigma \times D^*S_1$.
If $\alpha + x \d \phi + y \d \theta$ is the contact structure on $\operatorname{OB}(\Sigma, \dots)$,
then as explained in \cite[Section 5.3]{DG12}, $\alpha + x \d \phi$ is a 
$S^1_\phi$-invariant contact form on $\Gamma$,
\[
    \omega_\pm = \pm \d \left(\frac{\alpha}{y} + \frac{x}{y}\d \phi\right) 
\]
is an $S^1_\phi$-invariant symplectic form on $V_\pm$ and
$y$ is a function with zero level set $\pm \Gamma = \partial V_\pm$.
Hence, $(V_\pm, \omega_\pm)$ is an ideal Liouville domain with Liouville form
\[
    \beta_\pm = \pm \left(\frac{\alpha}{y} + \frac{x}{y}\d \phi\right).
\]
According to \cref{def:giroux_domain}, $V_\pm \times S^1_\theta$
endowed with the contact structure 
\[
    \ker(y \d \theta + y \beta_\pm) = \alpha + x \d \phi + y \d \theta
\]
is the corresponding Giroux domain. Clearly, this is just the restriction
of the open book contact structure. Hence, the whole procedure actually yields a
splitting into two Giroux domains
\[
    \operatorname{OB}(\Sigma, \dots) = V_+ \times S^1_\theta 
    \bigcup_{\Gamma \times S^1_\theta} V_- \times S^1_\theta
\]

\subsection*{Blowdown of embedded Giroux domains}
Given a embedded Giroux domain, this section describes a operation that is often 
called "blowdown".

Technically, it is not the Giroux domain itself that is blown down, but one or more 
of its boundary components. 
These boundary components are always of the form $B = M \times S^1$.
Topologically, we can simply glue in $M \times D^2$.

This operation can be performed in a way that respects the contact structure,
provided that $S^1 \times M$ has a neighborhood
of the form $[0, \epsilon)_s \times S^1_t \times M$ where $\alpha_M + s \d t$
defines a contact form.
In general this holds by \cite[Lemma 5.1]{MNW13} if the boundary components 
are $\xi$-round hypersurfaces, but it is also possible to show this directly.

Let $D$ be the disk of radius $\epsilon$ in $\mathbb R^2$. The map 
\[
    \Psi \colon (re^{i\theta} , m) \mapsto (r^2, \theta, m)
\]
is a diffeomorphism from $(D \setminus \{0\}) \times M$ to 
$(0, \epsilon) \times S^1 \times M$ which pulls back $\alpha_B + s \d t$ 
to the contact form $\alpha_M + r^2 \d\theta$. 
%check pullback!
Provided that there is such a neighborhood of $M \times S^1$ as described above, 
we can glue $D \times M$ to $V \setminus B$ to get a new contact manifold 
in which $B$ has been replaced by $M$.
%add image here!

Now there is a further procedure which we will also call blow-down and
which can be realized by a cobordism: Given an embedded Giroux domain,
remove its interior and blow down the resulting boundary components.

In our situation, we want to blow down the Giroux domain $V_- \times S^1$.
Its boundary is given by 
\[
    \partial V_- \times S^1 = \Gamma \times S^1.
\]
