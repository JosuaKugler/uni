\begin{definition}[ideal Liouville domain] \cite[Definition 1]{Giroux20}
An ideal Liouville domain
$(F, \omega)$ is a domain $F$ endowed with an ideal Liouville structure $\omega$. This
ideal Liouville structure is an exact symplectic form on $\operatorname{int} F$
admitting a primitive $\lambda$ such that: for some (and then any) function 
$u \colon F \to \mathbb R_{\geq 0}$  with regular level set $\partial F = \{u = 0\}$,
the product $u\lambda$ extends to a smooth 1-form on $F$ which 
induces a contact form on $\partial F$.
\end{definition}

Start with a Bourgeois manifold $\operatorname{BO}(\Sigma,\dots)$.
Smoothly, we have
\[
    \operatorname{BO}(\Sigma,\dots) = \operatorname{OB}(\Sigma, \dots) \times T^2 
    = \big[\operatorname{OB}(\Sigma, \dots) \times S^1\big] \times S^1 
    \eqqcolon V \times S^1
\]
According to \cite[Section 6]{DG12} we obtain a convex decomposition of the first factor
\[
    V = V_+ \bigcup_\Gamma \overline{V}_-,
\]
where $V_\pm$ are ideal Liouville domains and $\Gamma$ is the dividing set.
In \cite[Section 5.3]{DG12}, the authors explicitly compute $V_\pm$ for the Bourgeois
construction and obtain %maybe make a picture here?
\[
    V_+ = p^{-1}([0, \pi]) \times S^1, \qquad V_- = p^{-1}([\pi, 2\pi]) \times S^1,
\]
i.e. topologically we get $V_\pm = \Sigma \times D^*S_1$.

We know that $V_\pm$ are ideal Liouville domains.
But why are $V_\pm \times S^1$ with the induced contact structure
round contactizations of $V_\pm$ and hence Giroux domains? -> see DG12, section 6
Is it important that they are Giroux domains?

The products $V_\pm \times S^1$ are Giroux domains, 
    as they are round contactizations of ideal Liouville domains.
    My guess would be that a contactization works similar to a symplectization:
    One takes a symplectic manifold $\times \mathbb R$ and it becomes a contact manifold.
    A round contactization takes a manifold $\times S^1$.

What is the effect of the blowdown?
The blowdown is applied to the boundary components of the Giroux domain.
