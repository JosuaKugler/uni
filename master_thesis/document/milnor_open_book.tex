\section*{The Milnor open book}

\paragraph*{The open book coming from an $A_{k-1}$-singularity}
Define $f\colon \mathbb C^n \to \mathbb C$ by sending
\[
    (z_0, \dots, z_{n-1}) \mapsto z_0^k + z_1^2 + \dots z_{n-1}^2.  
\]
Consider the sphere $S^{2n-1} \subset \mathbb C^n$.
The intersection $f^{-1}(0) \cap S^{2n-1}$ is the so called Brieskorn sphere $B = \Sigma_{n-1}(k,2,\dots,2)$.
On the complement $S^{2n-1} \setminus B$, the map
\[
    \pi_f\colon S^{2n-1}\setminus B \to S^1\colon (z_0, \dots, z_{n-1}) \mapsto \frac{f(z_0, \dots, z_{n-1})}{|f(z_0, \dots, z_{n-1})|}
\]
is a fibration over $S^1$, the Milnor fibration.
It's fibers (the Milnor fibers) form the pages of the open book.

Alternative description: Positive stabilization of the standard open book $OB(D^{2n-2}, \mathrm{Id})$,
i.e. $S^{2n-1} = OB(D^*S^{n-1}, \tau)$ where $\tau$ is the Dehn-Seidel-twist.
Is this really the stabilization?
Attach a $D^{n-1} \times D^{n-2}$ ($n-1$-handle) to the page.
The $2$-dimensional drawing suggests that at least the topology works out, i.e.
\[
    D^{2n-2} \cup h_{n-1} = D^*S^{n-1}.
\]

Why (and in what sense) are the two descriptions equal? This is proven somewhere, see questions.md.

Summarizing the previous paragraph, we now have an open book decomposition of $S^{2n-1}$.
We can apply the Thurston-Winkelnkemper construction to construct a supported contact structure
and then, via the Bourgeois construction, obtain a contact structure on $S^{2n-1} \times T^2$.
