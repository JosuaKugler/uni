  abstract = {We give a bordism-theoretic characterization of those closed almost contact \$(2q\{+ \}1)\$-manifolds (with \$q{\textbackslash}geq 2\$) that admit a Stein fillable contact structure. Our method is to apply Eliashberg's \$h\$-principle for Stein manifolds in the setting of Kreck's modified surgery. As an application, we show that any simply connected almost contact 7-manifold with torsion-free second homotopy group is Stein fillable. We also discuss the Stein fillability of exotic spheres and examine subcritical Stein fillability.},

  abstract  = {This text on contact topology is a comprehensive introduction to the subject, including recent striking applications in geometric and differential topology: Eliashberg's proof of Cerf's theorem via the classification of tight contact structures on the 3-sphere, and the Kronheimer-Mrowka proof of property P for knots via symplectic fillings of contact 3-manifolds. Starting with the basic differential topology of contact manifolds, all aspects of 3-dimensional contact manifolds are treated in this book. One notable feature is a detailed exposition of Eliashberg's classification of overtwisted contact structures. Later chapters also deal with higher-dimensional contact topology. Here the focus is on contact surgery, but other constructions of contact manifolds are described, such as open books or fibre connected sums. This book serves both as a self-contained introduction to the subject for advanced graduate students and as a reference for researchers.},

We prove that all such structures are universally tight in dimension 5, independent of whether the original contact manifold is itself tight or overtwisted. In arbitrary dimensions, we provide obstructions to the existence of strong symplectic fillings of Bourgeois manifolds. This gives a broad class of new examples of weakly but not strongly fillable contact 5-manifolds, as well as the first examples of weakly but not strongly fillable contact structures in all odd dimensions. These obstructions are particular instances of more general obstructions for \$\$\{{\textbackslash}mathbb \{S\}\}{\textasciicircum}1\$\$-invariant contact manifolds. We also obtain a classification result in arbitrary dimensions, namely that the unit cotangent bundle of the n-torus has a unique symplectically aspherical strong filling up to diffeomorphism.},

We also prove that a \$C{\textasciicircum}0\$-generic family of mutually disjoint closed hypersurfaces parametrized by \$t {\textbackslash}in [0,1]\$ is convex except at finitely many times \$t\_1, {\textbackslash}dots, t\_N\$, and that crossing each \$t\_i\$ corresponds to a bypass attachment.

We also find the first examples of contact manifolds in all dimensions that are not symplectically fillable but also cannot be called overtwisted in any reasonable sense.

Each tangent plane Tx(Σ), x ∈ Σ, contains a unique complex line ξx ⊂ Tx(Σ) which we will call a complex tangency to Σ at x. The complex tangency is canonically oriented and, therefore, cooriented. Hence the tangent plane distribution ξ on Σ can be defined by an equation α = 0 where the 1-form α is unique up to multiplication by a positive function. The 2-form dα ∣ξ is defined up to the multiplication by the same positive factor. We say that Σ is J-convex (or pseudo-convex) if dα(T, JT) \&gt; 0 for any non-zero vector T ∈ ξx, x ∈ Σ. We use the word “pseudo-convex” when the almost complex structure J is not specified.An important property of a J-convex hypersurface Σ is that it cannot be touched inside (according to the canonical coorientation of Σ) by a J-holomorphic curve. In particular, if Ω is a domain in X bounded by a smooth J-convex boundary ∂Ω then all interior points of a J-holomorphic curve C ⊂ X with ∂C ⊂ ∂Ω belong to IntΩ. Moreover, C is transversal to ∂Ω in all regular points of its boundary ∂C.},
