  abstract = {We describe a necessary and sufficient condition for a principal circle bundle over an even-dimensional manifold to carry an invariant contact structure. As a corollary, it is shown that if the trivial circle bundle over a given base manifold carries an invariant contact structure, then so do all circle bundles over that base. In particular, all circle bundles over 4-manifolds admit invariant contact structures. We also discuss the Bourgeois construction of contact structures on odd-dimensional tori in this context, and we relate our results to recent work of Massot, Niederkrüger and Wendl on weak symplectic fillings in higher dimensions.},

Starting with the basic differential topology of contact manifolds, all aspects of 3-dimensional contact manifolds are treated in this book. One notable feature is a detailed exposition of Eliashberg's classification of overtwisted contact structures. Later chapters also deal with higher-dimensional contact topology. Here the focus is on contact surgery, but other constructions of contact manifolds are described, such as open books or fibre connected sums. This book serves both as a self-contained introduction to the subject for advanced graduate students and as a reference for researchers.},

We prove that all such structures are universally tight in dimension 5, independent of whether the original contact manifold is itself tight or overtwisted. In arbitrary dimensions, we provide obstructions to the existence of strong symplectic fillings of Bourgeois manifolds. This gives a broad class of new examples of weakly but not strongly fillable contact 5-manifolds, as well as the first examples of weakly but not strongly fillable contact structures in all odd dimensions. These obstructions are particular instances of more general obstructions for \$\$\{{\textbackslash}mathbb \{S\}\}{\textasciicircum}1\$\$-invariant contact manifolds. We also obtain a classification result in arbitrary dimensions, namely that the unit cotangent bundle of the n-torus has a unique symplectically aspherical strong filling up to diffeomorphism.},

Each tangent plane Tx(Σ), x ∈ Σ, contains a unique complex line ξx ⊂ Tx(Σ) which we will call a complex tangency to Σ at x. The complex tangency is canonically oriented and, therefore, cooriented. Hence the tangent plane distribution ξ on Σ can be defined by an equation α = 0 where the 1-form α is unique up to multiplication by a positive function. The 2-form dα ∣ξ is defined up to the multiplication by the same positive factor. We say that Σ is J-convex (or pseudo-convex) if dα(T, JT) \&gt; 0 for any non-zero vector T ∈ ξx, x ∈ Σ. We use the word “pseudo-convex” when the almost complex structure J is not specified.An important property of a J-convex hypersurface Σ is that it cannot be touched inside (according to the canonical coorientation of Σ) by a J-holomorphic curve. In particular, if Ω is a domain in X bounded by a smooth J-convex boundary ∂Ω then all interior points of a J-holomorphic curve C ⊂ X with ∂C ⊂ ∂Ω belong to IntΩ. Moreover, C is transversal to ∂Ω in all regular points of its boundary ∂C.},

  title     = {Symplectic homology of {Brieskorn} manifolds},
  year      = {2016},
  abstract  = {We discuss various versions of symplectic homology in the context of Brieskorn manifolds and their Stein fillings. Under a certain index condition, some flavors of symplectic homology, namely SH⁺ and SˇH, are independent of the filling. Thus, they can be used to distinguish the contact structures on Brieskorn manifolds. We will examine their relative advantages and disadvantages compared to other invariant such as the formal homotopy class, contact homology and the mean Euler characteristic.

On a concrete example, Σ(2l, 2, 2, 2), we will show that SH⁺ and SˇH actually contain more information than contact homology. On the other hand, symplectic homology is always very hard to compute, and we can do so for Σ(2l, 2, 2, 2) only with the help of a symmetry of the manifold.

For more complicated examples, where the full computation of symplectic homology remains elusive, we will turn our attention to the mean Euler characteristic, which is a quantity derived from positive S¹-equivariant symplectic homology. While it contains significantly less information, its computation is essentially a matter of combinatorics. With this tool, we can prove that there exist infinitely many exotic but homotopically trivial contact structures on S⁷, S¹¹ and S¹⁵, which was previously known only for spheres of dimension 4m+1.

Moreover, SˇH has the algebraic structure of a unital, graded commutative ring, where multiplication is given by the pair-of-pants product. Again, the full ring structure is extremely hard to compute. However, for a large class of examples, we achieve a partial result in this direction: There is a generator s such that the combination of all products with s gives SˇH the structure of a free and finitely generated module over the ring of Laurent polynomials Z/2Z[s, s⁻¹]. In particular, SˇH is finitely generated as a Z/2Z-algebra, although its vector space dimension is infinite. Similarly, the usual symplectic homology SH of the filling can be given the structure of a finitely generated module over the polynomial ring Z/2Z[s].},
