  abstract  = {This text on contact topology is a comprehensive introduction to the subject, including recent striking applications in geometric and differential topology: Eliashberg's proof of Cerf's theorem via the classification of tight contact structures on the 3-sphere, and the Kronheimer-Mrowka proof of property P for knots via symplectic fillings of contact 3-manifolds. Starting with the basic differential topology of contact manifolds, all aspects of 3-dimensional contact manifolds are treated in this book. One notable feature is a detailed exposition of Eliashberg's classification of overtwisted contact structures. Later chapters also deal with higher-dimensional contact topology. Here the focus is on contact surgery, but other constructions of contact manifolds are described, such as open books or fibre connected sums. This book serves both as a self-contained introduction to the subject for advanced graduate students and as a reference for researchers.},

  abstract   = {Given a contact structure on a manifold V together with a supporting open book decomposition, Bourgeois gave an explicit construction of a contact structure on \$\$V {\textbackslash}times \{{\textbackslash}mathbb \{T\}\}{\textasciicircum}2\$\$. We prove that all such structures are universally tight in dimension 5, independent of whether the original contact manifold is itself tight or overtwisted. In arbitrary dimensions, we provide obstructions to the existence of strong symplectic fillings of Bourgeois manifolds. This gives a broad class of new examples of weakly but not strongly fillable contact 5-manifolds, as well as the first examples of weakly but not strongly fillable contact structures in all odd dimensions. These obstructions are particular instances of more general obstructions for \$\$\{{\textbackslash}mathbb \{S\}\}{\textasciicircum}1\$\$-invariant contact manifolds. We also obtain a classification result in arbitrary dimensions, namely that the unit cotangent bundle of the n-torus has a unique symplectically aspherical strong filling up to diffeomorphism.},

Specifically, we prove that any closed hypersurface in a contact manifold can be \$C{\textasciicircum}0\$-approximated by a convex one. We also prove that a \$C{\textasciicircum}0\$-generic family of mutually disjoint closed hypersurfaces parametrized by \$t {\textbackslash}in [0,1]\$ is convex except at finitely many times \$t\_1, {\textbackslash}dots, t\_N\$, and that crossing each \$t\_i\$ corresponds to a bypass attachment. As applications of CHT, we prove the existence of compatible (relative) open book decompositions for contact manifolds and an existence h-principle for codimension 2 contact submanifolds.},
