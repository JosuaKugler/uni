Carrying out the constructions of the previous sections, one starts with the Milnor open book decomposition of $S^{2n-1}$,
turns it into a contact manifold via the Thurston-Winkelnkemper construction and then constructs a
contact structure on $S^{2n-1} \times T^2$.
However, a contact structure on $S^{2n+1}$ is needed!

This is where surgery comes in useful: Surgery is a technique to change manifolds in a controlled way. See \cite{Milnor61}
The basic idea is that the product manifold $S^p \times S^q$ can be considered either 
\begin{align}
    \text{as the boundary of } &S^p \times D^{q+1},
    \intertext{or}
    \text{as the boundary of } &D^{p+1} \times D^q.
\end{align}
Hence, given any imbedding of $S^p \times D^{q+1}$ in a manifold $M$, we can remove the interior and replace it with $D^{p+1} \times S^q$.
