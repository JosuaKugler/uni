Carrying out the constructions of the previous sections, one starts with the Milnor open book decomposition of $S^{2n-1}$,
turns it into a contact manifold via the Thurston-Winkelnkemper construction and then constructs a
contact structure on $S^{2n-1} \times T^2$.
However, a contact structure on $S^{2n+1}$ is needed!

This is where surgery is useful: In general, surgery is a procedure to change manifolds in a controlled way (see \cite{Milnor61}).
The rough idea is that the product manifold $S^p \times S^q$ can be considered either 
\begin{align}
    \text{as the boundary of } &S^p \times D^{q+1},
    \intertext{or}
    \text{as the boundary of } &D^{p+1} \times D^q.
\end{align}
Hence, given any imbedding of $S^p \times D^{q+1}$ in a manifold $M$, we can remove the interior and replace it with $D^{p+1} \times S^q$.
This can be done in a smooth way (i.e. preserving the smooth structure of the manifold).

In the situation of this paper, $S^{2n-1} \times T^2$ has to be changed into $S^{2n+1}$. This can be done via surgery and the details will be explained further below.
However, preserving the smooth structure isn't enough: The contact structure has to be preserved, too.
Fortunately, there is suitable h-principle that allows to realize any surgery on contact manifolds in a contact way?
