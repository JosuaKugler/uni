\section*{Proof of tightness}
We now want to prove that the resulting contact structure is actually tight.
We show algebraic tightness which implies tightness according to \cite[Proposition 3.2 (1)]{BGMZ22}.
In example 2.10, we see that the Bourgeois contact structure on $S^{2n-1} \times T^2$ is 1-ADC, hence algebraically tight (ebd, (5)(c)). 
\underline{(explain that example?)}
As contact surgery gives us a Liouville cobordism from the original manifold to the surgered manifold \underline{(reference!)}, we can apply \cite[Proposition 3.2 (3)]{BGMZ22} to see that contact surgery preserves algebraic tightness.

The almost contact structure underlying $\xi_\mathrm{ex}$ is homotopic to the standard one:
Why does it suffice to show that the almost complex structure is homotopic to the standard one? Isn't there more to an almost contact structure than just the almost complex structure? Are all hyperplane distributions homotopic?
