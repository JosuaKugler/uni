\section*{Acknowledgments}

This endeavor wouldn't have been possible without the invaluable support of my advisor Prof. Moreno, who apart from patiently explaining mathematics to me
also was a great source of encouragement when I was insecure or discouraged.
I also want to thank the symplectic group for integrating me in their seminars and activities, explaining their work or other important concepts to me
and generally giving me mathematical and non-mathematical advice.

Special thanks go to my WG, friends and family for their encouragement and moral support. 

Most importantly, I want to thank God for being with me all the time. 
His guidance and support has kept my spirits and motivation high during the process and I want to close these acknowledgments by saying 
``\textit{soli deo gloria.}"
